# Agent Notes

## Build and Test

Run Pebble bridge checks and build from `pebblecode/`:

```sh
node --check src/pkjs/index.js
node test/protocol.test.js
node test/bridge.test.js
node test/bridge.integration.test.js
pebble build
```

Copy the installable bundle from the repo root:

```sh
cp pebblecode/build/pebblecode.pbw dist/t3pebble.pbw
```

## T3 Code

The app runs against stock T3 Code (the published `t3` CLI). Do not patch T3 Code, and do not reintroduce `--auth-token` or `orchestration.getSnapshot`; both were fork-only. The bridge authenticates with a bearer token from `t3 auth session issue` and uses the REST routes documented in `docs/t3code-compatibility.md`.

`./verify-t3pebble.sh` runs the bridge tests, builds the PBW, and smoke-tests against a real `t3 serve` on a throwaway data directory.

Thread lists are scoped: `SCOPE_ACTIVE` (0) or `SCOPE_SETTLED` (1), carried on `CMD_SELECT_HOST` with an offset. `CMD_SESSION_END` reports `scope`, `offset`, `matched` (the scope's total) and `other` (the opposite scope's total), which is everything the watch needs to label its footer rows without a second request. Footer rows are derived in `rebuild_footers()`, never sent.

`XMLHttpRequest` reports every pre-HTTP failure as status 0 with nothing else, so a sleeping laptop, a wrong port, a stopped server and an unresolvable name all used to arrive as `T3 unreachable`. `transportFailure()` reconstructs the diagnosis from the two things the phone does know — the address it dialled and how long the attempt took: silence to the full timeout is a machine that never answered, a fast failure is something answering "no". Errors it raises are tagged `transport`, which is what lets `refreshHosts()` say "all N hosts unreachable" — an HTTP reply, 502 included, is the server talking and must never be escalated into a claim about the link. None of these sentences may carry measured milliseconds: an offline row that differs byte-for-byte each poll defeats the row suppression below and spends Bluetooth every cycle, which `bridge.test.js` asserts against directly.

Host failures are per-host, never global: `refreshHosts()` turns a failed probe into an `offline` row carrying the reason and keeps going, and it logs one fault per down machine rather than one joined line, so two dead hosts cost two of the six fault-log slots instead of sharing a truncated one. The watch gives an offline host the whole panel for that sentence — the counts trio and the 64pt headline are dropped, since they would only read zero — and SELECT on an offline row retries the probe instead of opening a thread list that would sit out the full request timeout. Keep `HOST_FAILURE_LIMIT` (bridge), `HostItem.detail` and `ERROR_TEXT_MAX` (watch) in step; the smallest of them is what actually reaches the glass.

`pebblecode/protocol.json` is the single source of truth for the wire protocol and the build label. Add a key there, run `node tools/gen-protocol.js`, and it writes the generated blocks in `appinfo.json` `appKeys`, `main.c` and `src/pkjs/index.js` — the JS side uses string keys and the C side numeric ones, and both are emitted from the same table. Never hand-edit inside a `@generated protocol:begin/end` block. `node test/protocol.test.js` fails if any copy has drifted, and it also checks that the bridge's truncation limits fit inside the watch's fields (`HOST_FAILURE_LIMIT`/`HostItem.detail`, `SUMMARY_LIMIT`/`SessionItem.summary`, `sendError`/`ERROR_TEXT_MAX`).

`versionLabel` in `appinfo.json` is `buildLabel` with the leading `v` stripped, so keep `buildLabel` to `vMajor.Minor` — the SDK rejects a three-component version.

**The home screen animates nothing at rest, and that is a requirement, not an accident.** It is the screen that gets left open for hours, so with no request in flight `animation_active()` returns false there and no timer is registered at all. A machine working somewhere else is a fact, not an event: `draw_state_mark()` takes an `animated` flag which is false on the home screen, where colour and the filled shape already carry "running". Do not reintroduce a pulse, a blink, a live seconds counter or a marquee on this screen — anything that has to move needs a timer, and a timer here runs forever. The thread list is a surface you actively browse rather than park on, so it still passes `animated = true`.

The animation timer therefore runs only while something is in flight, at `BUSY_TICK_MS` (110 ms), plus the thread list's `IDLE_TICK_MS` (440 ms) when a row on it is running. `s_stream_phase` advances by `IDLE_TICK_STEP` on a slow tick so every consumer's existing divisor lands on the same on-glass rate; do not "fix" a divisor to compensate. The progress sweep lives on `s_host_rail_layer`, a 200x6 strip from `host_rail_box()` shown exactly while `busy_any()`, so a refresh against a sleeping laptop costs 72 repaints of a six-pixel band rather than of the whole panel. `draw_self_test()`'s walking digit is gated on `busy_any()` for the same reason — without a timer behind it, it would freeze wherever the last tick left it.

`sync_age_text()` reports minute granularity ("now", then "3m") because nothing redraws it faster than that: `minute_tick` rides the `MINUTE_UNIT` tick the system already runs for the clock, costs no wakeup of its own, and repaints only if the host or diagnostics window is actually on top. A live seconds counter would mean a timer purely to animate a caption.

`app_focus_service` stops the timer entirely when the app is not on the glass. Judge any change to this against `FRM` and the frames-per-second readout on the DIAG page, which exists to measure exactly this — a home screen sitting idle should hold at 0.0 Hz.

Requests in flight are one bitmask, `s_busy`, not five booleans, and every failure path goes through `enter_error_state()` — which clears the mask, releases the connecting screen, logs the fault and re-arms the refresh timer on `RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`. Do not clear busy flags by hand in a new error branch; the reason `enter_error_state` exists is that the two old paths cleared different subsets and neither rescheduled a poll.

`refreshHosts()` skips sending a `CMD_HOST_ITEM` whose fields are unchanged since the last poll, so `CMD_HOST_END`'s `total` is authoritative for `s_host_count` and index 0 no longer resets the list. Any new suppression has to keep that pairing, and `lastHostRow` must be cleared whenever the watch might not be holding what the phone thinks it is (a failed send, a settings change).

`ActionMenuDidCloseCb`'s second parameter is the performed `ActionMenuItem`, not the root level, despite the SDK's doc comment. Pass the level through `ActionMenuConfig.context` so `action_menu_hierarchy_destroy` has something to free.

Multi-host setup goes through one pasteable line per machine, `t3pebble1|<label>|<base URL>|<token>`, printed by the launch script and parsed by `parseServerBundle()` in the bridge. The settings page embeds that function's own source via `String(parseServerBundle)` rather than reimplementing it, so the two cannot drift — keep it free of helper calls. Pasting a line for an already-configured base URL updates that entry's token instead of appending.

`run-t3code-tailscale.sh` defaults to binding the Tailscale IP over plain HTTP. `T3PEBBLE_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1` opts into publishing loopback over tailnet HTTPS via `tailscale serve --bg` instead, which is what reaches a T3 Code desktop app that only listens on `127.0.0.1`. Keep the default path unchanged; the flag is additive. Auth is the same bearer token in both modes — do not add a pairing exchange to the bridge.

## Watch Install

`pebble` is Core Devices' pebble-tool 5.x, installed natively with `uv tool install --python 3.13 pebble-tool` and then `pebble sdk install latest`. It is no longer the `rebble/pebble-sdk` Docker wrapper, so the old rule about repo-relative PBW paths is gone — absolute host paths work. The previous wrapper is kept at `~/.local/bin/pebble-docker` if a build ever has to be reproduced against SDK 4.3.

SDK 4.33.1 builds with GCC 14 rather than 4.7.2. That turns on a lot of diagnostics the old toolchain never emitted, `-Wformat-truncation=` in particular; fix those by bounding the value rather than reaching for `ctx.pbl_suppress_newer_gcc_warnings()` in the wscript, which exists but hides real truncation. Pebble Time 2 is still the `emery` platform, so the `#error` guard on `PBL_DISPLAY_WIDTH`/`HEIGHT` and the 200x228 layout constants are unchanged.

The linker's "LOAD segment with RWX permissions" warning is inherent to the Pebble app binary format and is not actionable.

Normal install path:

```sh
pebble install --phone <phone-ip> dist/t3pebble.pbw
```

If `pebble install --phone ...` or `pebble ping --phone ...` times out fetching watch info, but the Core Devices/Pebble app dev server is open on port `9000`, bypass the old Pebble SDK handshake and install directly through the Core Devices WebSocket protocol.

Direct Core Devices install:

```sh
node - <<'NODE'
const fs = require("fs");
const phone = process.env.PEBBLE_PHONE || "100.76.64.6";
const pbwPath = process.env.PBW_PATH || "dist/t3pebble.pbw";
const pbw = fs.readFileSync(pbwPath);
const payload = Buffer.concat([Buffer.from([0x04]), pbw]);
const ws = new WebSocket(`ws://${phone}:9000/`);
const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
  console.error("Timed out waiting for install result");
  try { ws.close(); } catch (e) {}
  process.exit(2);
}, 60000);
let sent = false;

ws.addEventListener("open", () => {
  console.log("connected to Core Devices dev server");
});

ws.addEventListener("message", async (event) => {
  const data = event.data instanceof Blob
    ? Buffer.from(await event.data.arrayBuffer())
    : Buffer.from(event.data);
  const type = data[0];
  if (type === 0x07 && !sent) {
    sent = true;
    console.log("sending PBW bytes", pbw.length);
    ws.send(payload);
    return;
  }
  if (type === 0x05) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    const status = data.length >= 5 ? data.readUInt32LE(1) : data[1];
    console.log("install status", status === 0 ? "success" : "failure", `(${status})`);
    ws.close();
    process.exit(status === 0 ? 0 : 1);
  }
});

ws.addEventListener("error", (event) => {
  clearTimeout(timeout);
  console.error("websocket error", event.message || event.type || event);
  process.exit(1);
});
NODE
```

Known working phone Tailscale IP for Will's S23 Ultra: `100.76.64.6`.

Protocol notes:

- Connect to `ws://<phone-ip>:9000/`.
- Wait for server message type `0x07` (`07ff` means watch connected).
- Send one binary frame containing byte `0x04` followed by the PBW bytes.
- Install result is server message type `0x05`; little-endian status `0` means success.
