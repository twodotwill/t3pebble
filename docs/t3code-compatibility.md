# T3 Code Compatibility

This document records the T3 Code API surface T3 Pebble depends on.

## Target

Stock, unmodified T3 Code. The published `t3` CLI, installed with `npm install -g t3` or run through `npx t3@latest`.

Verified against `t3@0.0.33` and upstream `main` at `277322933` (`v0.0.34-nightly.20260816`).

There is no compatibility branch and no server patch. The earlier fork — which re-added `--auth-token`, legacy `?token=` WebSocket auth, and an `orchestration.getSnapshot` RPC — is no longer used.

## Required API Surface

### Auth

A bearer access token issued by the CLI:

```sh
t3 auth session issue --ttl 365d --label "T3 Pebble watch" --token-only
```

That grants `AuthAdministrativeScopes`, which includes the two scopes the app needs: `orchestration:read` and `orchestration:operate`. The token must be issued against the same data directory the server runs with (`--base-dir`, or the default).

Every REST request carries it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. There is no
pairing exchange or session cookie involved.

For model discovery when starting a thread, the bridge posts
the bearer token to `POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket`, then uses the returned
short-lived ticket as `wsTicket` on `/ws`. The bearer token is never placed in
the WebSocket URL.

### Reads

| Route | Used for |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/orchestration/shell` | Projects and thread lifecycle: one request per host |
| `GET /api/orchestration/threads/:threadId?turnLimit=N` | Thread bodies: messages, activities, session |
| `POST /api/auth/websocket-ticket` + `server.getConfig` WebSocket RPC | Live provider/model catalog for the new-thread picker |

The shell route serves `OrchestrationShellSnapshot`, the same read model the T3 web sidebar classifies from: no message bodies, but `session`, `latestTurn` and every lifecycle field. That is what the watch's list, roll-up and detail card all classify from, so the two clients cannot disagree; the thread detail route only supplies bodies.

`GET /api/orchestration/snapshot` also exists and returns the fuller command read model. The app does not use it — it is a bigger response and carries nothing the shell route does not.

Turn windows requested by the app:

- `turnLimit=6` for list rows and the detail card
- `turnLimit=40` for the transcript view

The thread detail response is `{ snapshotSequence, thread, page }`.

Provider snapshots are not present in either orchestration REST read model.
For a new thread, the phone reads `server.getConfig`, puts the project's
`defaultModelSelection` first, then lists live non-legacy models from enabled
and installed providers. The config is cached for five minutes. If the phone
runtime cannot open the WebSocket or the request fails, the menu contains only
the project default already returned by the shell route, so thread creation is
still available.

### Thread lifecycle parity

`threadState()` in the bridge is a port of T3's `effectiveSettled` / `effectiveSnoozed` (`packages/client-runtime/src/state/threadSettled.ts`) plus the bucket order the sidebar applies around them (`apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`): **snooze outranks a pin, a pin outranks settled**. Three things a thread can be blocked on all read as `needs`, matching the sidebar's status pills:

| Shell field | T3 pill | Watch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hasPendingApprovals` | Pending Approval | `needs`, reply routed to `thread.approval.respond` |
| `hasPendingUserInput` | Awaiting Input | `needs`, reply routed to `thread.user-input.respond` |
| `interactionMode === "plan"` + `hasActionableProposedPlan` + settled latest turn | Plan Ready | `needs`, reply sent as a normal turn |

`pinnedAt` suppresses the settled bucket entirely, including an explicit `settledOverride: "settled"` — the server's decider clears one on the other, so the two only ever coexist on a raced write.

**Settled is derived, not stored.** The API carries only `settledOverride` and `settledAt`, and both are null on a thread that settled by inactivity — every client computes the rest from the same shell fields. So "the server says it is settled" is not a thing that can be asked; a client that classifies differently is a client missing one of the inputs. The watch is missing two:

- **`sidebarAutoSettleAfterDays`.** A web client setting kept in `localStorage` and never sent to the server, so no route can carry it. It is entered by hand on the Pebble settings page instead (*Settle a quiet thread after*, days or blank for never, clamped to T3's 1–90) and defaults to T3's 3. Set it to whatever T3 is set to; leave them different and every thread quiet for longer than one window and less than the other reads settled on one client and idle on the other.
- **Change-request state.** T3 auto-settles a thread whose PR merged (when `sidebarAutoSettleOnMerge` is on) or closed, and refuses to auto-settle one with an open PR. The state comes from live VCS status, delivered over the `vcsRefreshStatus` **WebSocket RPC** — there is no REST equivalent, so it is out of reach for a bridge that only speaks the two read routes above. Threads with a merged or closed PR therefore stay active on the watch until they age out on inactivity.

### Writes

`POST /api/orchestration/dispatch`, carrying a `ClientOrchestrationCommand`:

- `project.create`
- `thread.create`
- `thread.turn.start`
- `thread.turn.interrupt`
- `thread.settle` / `thread.unsettle`
- `thread.approval.respond`
- `thread.user-input.respond`

`thread.unsettle` requires `reason: "user"`. Settling sets `settledAt` and
`settledOverride: "settled"`; unsettling clears `settledAt` and sets
`settledOverride: "active"`.

`project.create` honours `createWorkspaceRootIfMissing`, and the REST
normalizer resolves `workspaceRoot` before dispatch, so the watch can create a
project and its directory without an agent involved.

A malformed command is rejected with `400 invalid_request`.

#### Starting a thread takes two commands, not one

`thread.turn.start` accepts a `bootstrap.createThread` block that is supposed to
create the thread and start the first turn together. **Do not use it over REST.**
The REST handler validates the block and then ignores it: it calls
`orchestrationEngine.dispatch` directly, bypassing the `dispatchNormalizedCommand`
router that is the only thing routing a bootstrap command into the branch which
creates the thread. That router is wired into the WebSocket RPC path alone.

The visible symptom is a `500 orchestration_dispatch_failed`, because the turn
lands on a thread that does not exist yet:

```json
{"_tag":"OrchestrationCommandInvariantError","commandType":"thread.turn.start",
 "detail":"Thread '...' does not exist for command 'thread.turn.start'."}
```

Note that an invalid field inside the block still returns `400`, so the block
being accepted proves nothing about it being acted on.

So the bridge dispatches `thread.create` first and then `thread.turn.start`
against that thread id, carrying no bootstrap. Both commands carry the model
chosen on the watch; choosing the first row preserves the project's complete
server-side default selection, including its option values. Thread ids do not
have to be UUIDs; the bridge's own `pebble-thread-...` format is accepted.

### Error shapes

Errors are tagged JSON, for example:

```json
{"_tag":"EnvironmentAuthInvalidError","code":"auth_invalid","reason":"missing_credential","traceId":"..."}
```

The bridge reads `reason` / `requiredScope` for its status line. Relevant statuses: `401` (bad or missing token), `403` (missing scope), `404` with `reason: "thread_not_found"`.

## Notes

- `access-control-allow-origin` is `*`, so the PebbleKit JS sandbox can call the API directly.
- The bridge uses one non-subscription WebSocket RPC, `server.getConfig`, only when the user opens the new-thread model picker. Thread polling remains on the REST routes; the subscription RPCs (`orchestration.subscribeShell`, `orchestration.subscribeThread`) are still a poor fit for a watch that polls.
- `t3 serve` supports `--host`, `--port`, `--base-dir`, and `--no-browser`, which is all the launch script needs. Mainline also ships `--tailscale-serve` if you would rather it manage Tailscale itself.
